# Chess_project

## Introduction
Welcome to my chess project version 1.0 !
I made this chess project in C++, using QT for the front end. It was a simple, yet interesting project to make.
I hope you have fun trying it or looking at the code. 

All the code has been commented to make it easy to read. All the algorithms for the pieces have been implemented and the code is well structured.

## Installation/Testing
Installation is easy and simple for everyone.

You don't need to install QT to try out the project! The executable file is in the zip folder `Chess_Project-Version1.0`.
All you need to do is to install unzip the folder and click on the chess_project.exe and you should be good! 

> Note that it only works for windows x64

## Features 

### Situation Menu
At first when you will launch the program, you will see an empty board. You have 4 different choices and they're each a different situation. 

For example, the first option, looks something like this:

All the situations are differend and more can be added in the future. 

### Dead Pieces 

Whenever there are dead pieces, they end up in one of the two different layouts. There's one for the white dead pieces and there's one for the black dead pieces.
Let's keep the same situation as above and make the king eat one of the white rooks.

We can see here that the dead piece is showed on the side. Other pieces will fit in this frame as the game or situation progresses. 

## Ameliorations

There are a lot of things that can be done to make a better chess project. For example a little feature could be to let the user make his own situations. Also, I could've let the user change the color of the board, the way the pieces are represented, creating new pieces with new effects and much more. 

As for the code, castling isn't implemented and testing is non existant. 

For the technologies, the game can be put on a site web, with a database, API requests, accounts, MMR and much more. Well this is chess.com, but we can all agree that chess.com is the peak in terms of chess online. Making a site like that would require many different technologies and not using QT because it's limiting. 

Enjoy this little project and I hope you can learn from it if you're using QT. Ask me any questions about the project if it's not clear and I'll be happy to answer!
